This application connects job seekers and job providers, by simply entering a resume, <br />
the job vacancies that match the resume will be displayed, and applicants can easily apply. <br />
We hope that this application can help job seekers to find the job they want. <br />

We use CNN-LSTM algorithm with 100d GloVe pretrained words embedding for the machine <br />
learning model.
